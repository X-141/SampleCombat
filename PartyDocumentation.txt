This is the documentation for v3 party assembler for the 
following sample combat program

The current set of rules for creating party file is as follows:
1. first line of the file must indicate the partyID for the program
    to read
    1a. The first line indicating the partyID SHOULD range from 0 to 'n'
        'n' representing the total cardinality of the party directory.
    1b. special case is given for partyID == 0. This party will represent
        the main player party class for which they can control. Every partyID
        (unless further special cases are given) from 1 to n will indicate
        an opposing party.
2. EntityID values must range from 0 to 'n'. 'n' representing the total range of
    entities in the party.

Current syntax for v3 are as follows:
{PartyID}:{EntityName}:{EntityLevel}:{EntityHealth}:{EntityAttack}:{EntityDefense}
    >   PartyID == from values 0 to 'n'
    >   EntityName == Name given to entity of the party
    >   EntityLevel == Level modifier for the entity
    >   EntityHealth-EntityAttack-EntityDefense == Self explanitory.


Sample "Party0.txt": -> typically you should match the partyID with the title of .txt
